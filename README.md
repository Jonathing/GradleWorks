# GradleWorks

Welcome to the GitHub repository for GradleWorks! GradleWorks is an attempt to make your life using ForgeGradle much, much easier, by automating the entirety of build.gradle and even adding some very nice features to it.

Want to use GradleWorks in your project or want to know more about how it works? I wrote a small [wiki](https://github.com/Jonathing/GradleWorks/wiki) that might probably have everything you'll need to know.
